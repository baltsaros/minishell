## **Project description** 
This project is about creating a simple shell. Bash was used as a reference.

The shell should:
* > Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
* > Have a working history.
* > Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
* > Not use more than one global variable. Think about it. You will have to explain its purpose.
* > Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
* > Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
* > Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
* > Implement redirections
* > Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
* > Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
* > Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
* > Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
* > Your shell must implement the following builtins (without options): echo (with -n), cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit

## **How to use**
* *make* - to compile the executable file
* execute it with *./minishell*
* there are three user mods: *normal*, *secret* and *uwu*. Try them all!

## **Our approach**
* We splitted the project into seven parts: prompt, tokenization, token simplification (added later), parsing, execution, exit and signal. I (baltsaros) would say that tokenization is the most important, because it determines how other parts are done
* In our tokenization we read character by character and then create an according token (in a linked list). Main tokens that we used are WORD, WSPACE(for white spaces) and some special characters like _$_, _*_, _>_, etc. Values for the latter correspond to ther ASCII values or in case of double characters (like << or >>) to their ASCII value + 100
* We decided to expand _*_ in tokenization and _$_ in token simplification, since it was easier to do this at earlier stages
* In token simplification we fuse some tokens (mainly quotes) and remove others (like white spaces)
* In parsing we open files, initiate heredoc (if any) and creates future commands
* Then we do the execution! Before any _execve_ we check whether a current cmd is builtin or not. We also decided to wait for every child in case of pipe(s) in order to always have a proper output when all or some of the incoming cmds work with the same file. Without _waitpid_ output order or its content for cmds like _echo one > f1 | echo two >> f2 | echo three >> f3_ can be messed up
* We have several structures: one is integral (*t_input*) and is used almost in any other function. Another important structure is *t_cmd* that is actually a linked list. One command is one linked list that consists of command arguments, input and output fds (0 and 1 by default), input and output file names, delimiter (if any) and pipe flag. We also have two other linked lists: one for tokens and another one for envp. Envp are also saved in the _char**_ form in order to be able to send it into another _./minishell_

* Read through the subject with your partner and divide the parts
* Ask peers how they approached the project
* Learn about lexer and parser
